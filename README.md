# Number Palindrome Checker ðŸ”¢ðŸ”„

Welcome to the **Number Palindrome** repository! This project helps you determine if a number is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. For example, 121 and 12321 are palindromes, while 123 is not.

## Introduction

In this project, you will find a simple and efficient way to check if a number is a palindrome. It is built with clear logic and aims to be user-friendly. Whether you're learning about palindromes or need a tool for quick checks, this repository has you covered.

## Features

- Simple interface for checking palindromes.
- Fast execution time.
- Easy to integrate into other projects.
- Clear and concise documentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **Number Palindrome** project, you can download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/virzfr/Number-Palindrome/releases) section. This will provide you with the necessary files to run the application.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- Any code editor (like VSCode, PyCharm, etc.)

### Installation

1. Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/virzfr/Number-Palindrome/releases) section.
2. Download the latest release file.
3. Extract the files to your desired directory.

## Usage

To use the Number Palindrome checker, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the files.
3. Run the script using the command:

   ```bash
   python palindrome_checker.py
   ```

4. Input the number you want to check when prompted.

### Example

```plaintext
Enter a number: 121
121 is a palindrome.
```

```plaintext
Enter a number: 123
123 is not a palindrome.
```

## How It Works

The logic behind checking if a number is a palindrome is straightforward:

1. Convert the number to a string.
2. Reverse the string.
3. Compare the original string with the reversed string.
4. If they match, the number is a palindrome.

This approach is efficient and easy to understand.
